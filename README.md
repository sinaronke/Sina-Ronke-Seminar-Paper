# The provided repository contains all steps for the development of different machine learning models to detetct misue in network traffic

# 1. First Step
# Cleaning the UNR-IDD Dataset

# 2. Second Step
# Explore features and Pre-selection

# 3.1 - 3.5 Binary classification
# Machine Learning Models: Predict "Binary Label" (Attack or Normal)

# 4.1 - 4.5 Multilabel classification
# Machine Leraning Models: Predict "Label" (Normnal or different Attacks)
