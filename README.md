# The provided repository contains all steps for the development of different machine learning models to detect misuse attacks in network traffic

# 1. First Step:  Cleaning the UNR-IDD Dataset

# 2. Second Step: Explore features and Pre-selection

# 3.1 - 3.5:      Machine Learning Models: Predict "Binary Label" (Attack or Normal)

# 4.1 - 4.5       Machine Learning Models: Predict "Label" (Normal or different Attacks)
